# Code Information for Course Chat Bot

Because there needs to be a way for the code to know all the courses, the only other file than the main.py file (used to run the code) is the responses.json packet file which is included within the zip.

All the code was written by myself along with the extraction of the json data file.

Only needs to be run to start the chat bot conversation.
